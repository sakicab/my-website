      <h2>Prison Joke</h2>
      <p>
        An old man lived alone in Minnesota. He wanted to spade his potato garden, but it was very hard work. His only son, who would have helped him, was in prison.
        The old man wrote a letter to his son and mentioned his predicament. <br><br>
        <em>Dear Son, I am feeling pretty bad, because it looks like I won't be able to plant my potato garden this year. I hate to miss doing the garden, because your mother always loved planting time. I'm just getting too old to be digging up a garden plot. If you were here, all my troubles would be over. I know you would dig the plot for me, if you weren't in prison.</em><br><br>
        Love, Dad<br><br>
        Shortly, the old man received this telegram: <em>"For HEAVEN'S SAKE, Dad, don't dig up the garden! That's where I buried the GUNS!"</em><br><br>
        At 4 A.M. the next morning, a dozen FBI agents and local police officers showed up and dug up the entire garden without finding any guns. <br><br>
        Confused, the old man wrote another note to his son telling him what happened, and asking him what to do next. <br><br>
        His son's reply was: <em>"Go ahead and plant your potatoes, Dad. It's the best I could do for you at this time."</em>
