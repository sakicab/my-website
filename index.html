      <h2 class="toggle-title">Prison Joke</h2>
      <div class="anecdote-content">
        <p>An old man lived alone in Minnesota. He wanted to spade his potato garden, but it was very hard work. His only son, who would have helped him, was in prison.</p>
         <p><em>Dear Son, I am feeling pretty bad, because it looks like I won't be able to plant my potato garden this year. I hate to miss doing the garden, because your mother always loved planting time. I'm just getting too old to be digging up a garden plot. If you were here, all my troubles would be over. I know you would dig the plot for me, if you weren't in prison.</em></p> 

        <p>Love, Dad</p> 

        <p>Shortly, the old man received this telegram: <em>"For HEAVEN'S SAKE, Dad, don't dig up the garden! That's where I buried the GUNS!"</em></p> 

        <p>At 4 A.M. the next morning, a dozen FBI agents and local police officers showed up and dug up the entire garden without finding any guns.</p> 

        <p>Confused, the old man wrote another note to his son telling him what happened, and asking him what to do next.</p> 

        <p>His son's reply was: <em>"Go ahead and plant your potatoes, Dad. It's the best I could do for you at this time."</em></p>
