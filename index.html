        <p>On their way to getting married, a young couple is involved in a fatal car accident. They find themselves sitting outside the Pearly Gates, waiting for St. Peter to process them into Heaven. While waiting, they begin to wonder: Could they possibly get married in Heaven? When St. Peter shows up, they ask him.</p>
        <p><strong>St. Peter:</strong> "I don't know. This is the first time anyone has asked that. Let me go and find out."</p>
        <p>The couple sit and wait. Two months pass and they are still waiting. As they wait, they discuss the eternal aspect of marriage. "What if it doesn't work? Are we stuck together forever?"</p>
        <p><strong>St. Peter:</strong> "Yes, you can get married in Heaven."</p>
        <p><strong>The Couple:</strong> "Great! But what if things don't work out? Can we also get a divorce in Heaven?"</p>
        <p>St. Peter, red-faced with frustration, slams his clipboard onto the ground.</p>
        <p><strong>The Couple:</strong> "What's wrong?"</p>
        <p><strong>St. Peter:</strong> "OH, COME ON! It took me three months to find a priest up here! Do you have any idea how long it'll take me to find a lawyer?"</p>

      <h2 class="toggle-title">Prison Joke</h2>
      <div class="anecdote-content">
        <p>An old man lived alone in Minnesota. He wanted to spade his potato garden, but it was very hard work. His only son, who would have helped him, was in prison.</p>
        <p><em>Dear Son, I am feeling pretty bad, because it looks like I won't be able to plant my potato garden this year. I hate to miss doing the garden, because your mother always loved planting time. I'm just getting too old to be digging up a garden plot. If you were here, all my troubles would be over. I know you would dig the plot for me, if you weren't in prison.</em></p>
        <p>Love, Dad</p>
        <p>Shortly, the old man received this telegram: <em>"For HEAVEN'S SAKE, Dad, don't dig up the garden! That's where I buried the GUNS!"</em></p>
        <p>At 4 A.M. the next morning, a dozen FBI agents and local police officers showed up and dug up the entire garden without finding any guns.</p>
        <p>Confused, the old man wrote another note to his son telling him what happened, and asking him what to do next.</p>
        <p>His son's reply was: <em>"Go ahead and plant your potatoes, Dad. It's the best I could do for you at this time."</em></p>
